# [Shell Scripting: shebang](https://blwatkins.github.io/learn-to-code/unix/2025/05/22/unix-shell-scripts.html#shebang)

The first line of any shell script file should be the shebang line. The shebang line tells the operating system which Unix shell interpreter to use to execute the script. The shebang line starts with `#!` followed by the path to the interpreter.
