# [Shell Scripting: file extensions](https://blwatkins.github.io/learn-to-code/unix/2025/05/22/unix-shell-scripts.html#creating-a-shell-script-file)

The extension of your shell script file will vary depending on the shell you plan to execute it with and your personal preferences.

Most shell scripts use the `.sh` extension, for example `my-script.sh`.

If you are using the Bash shell, you can also use the `.bash` extension, for example `my-script.bash`.

If you are using the Z shell, you can use the `.zsh` extension, for example `my-script.zsh`.

You could also have a shell script file with no extension at all, for example `my-script`.
